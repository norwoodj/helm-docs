# most-empty

![Version: 0.2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.2.0-informational?style=flat-square)

This is a good example of all the fields that don't appear when they aren't set in chart metadata. `description`,
`requirements`, and `values` are all empty and don't appear here.

There is a flower though:
```
          ,-.
